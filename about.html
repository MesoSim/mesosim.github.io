    <h1>What is MesoSim?</h1>

    <p>Let that brush dance around there and play. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. All those little son of a guns. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. We don't have anything but happy trees here.</p>

    <p>Only eight colors that you need. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Don't fight it, use what happens. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. See there how easy that is. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.</p>

    <p>Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Work that paint. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.</p>

    <p>I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. This is unplanned it really just happens. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.</p>

    <p>There he comes. We'll play with clouds today. You can spend all day playing with mountains. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book.</p>

    <p>Don't be bashful drop me a line. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Take your time. Speed will come later.</p>

    <p>From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. You gotta think like a tree. Just use the old one inch brush. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.</p>

    <p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.</p>
